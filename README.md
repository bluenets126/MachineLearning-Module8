Final lab for Class 7 Machine Learning.

Assumptions:  Only use file provided financial_loan_data.csv.
              Only need to either predict loan approval and/or Risk score (Did Classification of loan approval)
              If you're calculating Loan Approval or RiskScore, neither can be used as features in the calculations since they are heavily correlated and probably would not be there for future unseen data.
